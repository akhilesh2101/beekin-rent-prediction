    "Model Risk and Design Memo: Rent Prediction System\n",
    "\n",
    "Date: January 11, 2026\n",
    "To: Product & Engineering Teams\n",
    "From: Data Science\n",
    "Re: Production Model Design Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Feature Risks & Exclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Features to EXCLUDE even if they improve accuracy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Race/ethnicity demographics - Fair Housing Act violations; proxies for protected classes\n",
    "- School district names - Indirect proxy for neighborhood demographics\n",
    "- Exact street addresses - Privacy concerns; creates overfitting to specific buildings\n",
    "\n",
    "Features to include with caution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Census education/commuter rates - Legitimate economic indicators but monitor for discriminatory patterns\n",
    "- Geographic coordinates - Essential for location pricing but round to prevent exact address inference\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Temporal Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Refresh Frequency: Weekly (Every Monday 3 AM)\n",
    "\n",
    "Rationale:\n",
    "- Rental market changes gradually; daily refreshes add noise\n",
    "- Based on 2022 data showing ~3% quarterly variance\n",
    "- Balances freshness with model stability\n",
    "\n",
    "Volatile Market Strategy:\n",
    "- Exponential time weighting: recent listings weighted 2x vs. 6-month-old data\n",
    "- Add market velocity feature: 30-day rolling price change by ZIP\n",
    "- Emergency retraining trigger: week-over-week median prediction error > 10%\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Failure Detection (Silent Degradation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitoring Checks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Drift: KS test on feature distributions (p < 0.05 threshold)\n",
    "2. Prediction Distribution: Alert if 95th percentile prediction > 2x historical\n",
    "3. Missing Data: Flag if > 20% rows have NULL in key features\n",
    "4. Geographic Coverage: Error if previously-seen blockgroup has < 5 listings in 90 days\n",
    "5. Model Staleness: Automated alert if model age > 14 days\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Monotonicity Trade-offs\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Monotonic Relationships:\n",
    "- sqft ↑ → price ↑\n",
    "- beds ↑ → price ↑ (generally)\n",
    "- baths ↑ → price ↑\n",
    "\n",
    "Current Situation: XGBoost has NO monotonicity constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accuracy gain: ~1-2% better MAPE without constraints\n",
    "- Risk: Model may predict smaller units cost more (erodes user trust)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Enforce monotonicity on sqft only (95% correlation with price).\n",
    "\n",
    "Accept ~0.5% accuracy degradation for explainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beds/baths remain flexible (studio apartments break monotonicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation: Use XGBoost's monotone_constraints parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Framework: Prioritize user trust and legal compliance over marginal accuracy gains."
